> Given a solid ball in 3‑dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball.

In the original article how many subsets are in the decomposition?

1. 1
2. 2

1. 9
2. 10

What are the names for `\(X, Y, f(X), f^{-1}(S)\)` for `\(S\subseteq Y\)`?

1. domain, subdomain, image, inverse-image 
2. domain, target, needle, haystack
3. **domain, codomain, image, pre-image**
4. domain, target, image, inverse-image
5. source, subdomain, image, invers-image
6. source, target, needle, haystack
7. source, codomain, image, pre-image
8. source, target, image, inverse-image

## 2. Curve

.center[![What is the name of this curve?](image/question_02.png)]

What is the name of the above curve?

1. **Koch Curve**
2. Klein Curve
3. Guass Curve
4. Jordan Curve
5. Hilbert Curve
6. Cantor Curve

???

The Koch Curve has an infinite perimiter, but "encloses" finite area. It has been studied by Koch because it is a *continous* curve, which is nowhere *differentiable*.

## 3. Sum

$$1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} + \ldots$$

Which value equals this infinite sum?

1. `\(\frac{\pi}{1}\)`
2. `\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)`
3. `\(\frac{\pi}{3}\)`
4. `\(\quad\frac{\pi}{4}\)`
5. `\(\frac{\pi}{5}\)`
6. `\(\frac{\pi}{6}\)`
7. `\(\frac{\pi}{7}\)`
8. `\(\frac{\pi}{8}\)`

???

This can be seen by Fourier analysing `\(f:[0,\pi] \rightarrow [-\frac{pi}{2},\frac{pi}{2}]: x \mapsto \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}-x}{2}\)`

## 4. Theorem

> Given a continous function `\(f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)` such that `\(f(a)\cdot f(b)<0\)`, there exist a `\(c\in(a,b)\)` such that `\(f(c)=0\)`.

What is the name of this theorem?

1. **Bolzano's theorem.**
2. Intermediate value theorem.
3. Mean value theorem.
4. Rolle theorem.

???

Bolzano's theorem is a special case of the intermediate value theorem. 
Rolle's theorem is a special case of the mean value theorem.
Intermediate value theorem can be used to prove the mean value theorem.

The *Banach-Tarski Paradox* states

> Given a solid ball in 3‑dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball.

In the original article how many subsets are in the decomposition?

1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 4
5. **5**
6. 6
7. 7
8. 8
9. 9

???

This paradoxical statement is true if one allows the *axiom of choice*. The decomposition hinges on a decomposition of the free group on two generators and a presentation for that.
