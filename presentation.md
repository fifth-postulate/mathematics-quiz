## 2. Curve

What is the name of the above curve?

1. **Koch Curve**
2. Klein Curve
3. Guass Curve
4. Jordan Curve
5. Hilbert Curve
6. Cantor Curve

???

The Koch Curve has an infinite perimiter, but "encloses" finite area. It has been studied by Koch because it is a *continous* curve, which is nowhere *differentiable*.

## 3. Sum

$$1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} + \ldots$$

Which value equals this infinite sum?

1. `\(\frac{\pi}{1}\)`
2. `\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)`
3. `\(\frac{\pi}{3}\)`
4. `\(\quad\frac{\pi}{4}\)`
5. `\(\frac{\pi}{5}\)`
6. `\(\frac{\pi}{6}\)`
7. `\(\frac{\pi}{7}\)`
8. `\(\frac{\pi}{8}\)`

???

This can be seen by Fourier analysing `\(f:[0,\pi] \rightarrow [-\frac{pi}{2},\frac{pi}{2}]: x \mapsto \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}-x}{2}\)`

# 12. Monster Group

The monster group is the largest of the sporadic simple finite groups.

How many digits does it take to write down the order (size) of the monster group?

The order is

```plain
808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000
```

which has 54 digits
